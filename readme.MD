# data structures and algorithms

This repo is used to learn and implement data structure and algorithms

all the implementations are done in C99, for the reason that this language gives the student a more deep and concise understanding of how the data structures work behind the stages that the modern languages as JS and Java build

the code that you're going to find in this repositories are solutions that use data structures (stack, linked-list, tree, hash) to solve problems
